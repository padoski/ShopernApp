# ShopernClone
I made a clone of my project to protect the API Keys ;)


ShopEarn app is used to post announcements for making grocery shopping. The application has two interfaces, one for adding orders and next one for the driver. You can save a lot of daily time by ordering someone to make purchases!

Main functionality<br />
Customer:<br />
-Maps, adding an advertisement / order<br />
-Possibility to chat with people with whom we have interacted(they accepted our advertisement or we accepted them)<br />
-Choosing the exact date for which we want to get our purchases<br />
-Choosing the location where we want to get our order<br />
-Ability to view our orders, delete them(up-to-date and completed orders)<br />
Customer:<br />
-Searching for orders based on distance, possibility of accepting and executing them<br />
-Preview of ads on the map<br />

What tech I used?<br />
-React Native,<br />
-AWS Amplify(Authentication, GraphQL API, Lambda Functions, Real time data for messages),<br />
-Google Maps API(Maps, Geolocation, Places Autocomplete),<br />
