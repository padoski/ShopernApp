# ShopernClone
I made a clone of my project to protect the API Keys ;)
Goal of the project
With a pleasure I will talk about a code on a job interview.
ShopEarn app is used to post announcements for making grocery shopping. The application has two interfaces, one for adding orders and next one for the driver. You can save a lot of daily time by ordering someone to make purchases!

Main functionality
Customer:
-Maps, adding an advertisement / order
-Possibility to chat with people with whom we have interacted(they accepted our advertisement or we accepted them)
-Choosing the exact date for which we want to get our purchases
-Choosing the location where we want to get our order
-Ability to view our orders, delete them(up-to-date and completed orders)
Customer:
-Searching for orders based on distance, possibility of accepting and executing them
-Preview of ads on the map

What tech I used?
-React Native,
-AWS Amplify(Authentication, GraphQL API, Lambda Functions, Real time data for messages),
-Google Maps API(Maps, Geolocation, Places Autocomplete),
